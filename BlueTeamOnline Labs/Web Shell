# Web Shell BTLO

## Overview
This investigation analyzed suspicious internal network traffic that triggered a SIEM alert for “Local to Local Port Scanning.”  
Using packet capture (PCAP) analysis, the activity was traced from reconnaissance (port scanning and enumeration) to exploitation (web shell upload and command execution).  
The attacker ultimately gained a reverse shell connection.
