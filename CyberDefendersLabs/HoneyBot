# HoneyBot - CyberDefenders Lab

## Overview
This lab focused on analyzing an automated attack against a honeypot using SMB and FTP protocols. The attacker exploited a known CVE, dropped a malware payload, and attempted remote code execution using shellcode. Through packet analysis and static shellcode examination, you uncovered the full exploitation timeline and payload behavior.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Wireshark** â€“ Protocol filtering, TCP stream analysis  
- **NetworkMiner** â€“ Session metadata and file reconstruction  
- **SCDBG** â€“ Static shellcode analysis  
- **VirusTotal** â€“ Threat intelligence and submission lookup  

---

## Notes
- The attack exploited SMB via `DsRoleUpgradeDownLevelServer` over DCERPC
- Malware was dropped via FTP from the attackerâ€™s host and reconstructed in hex
- Shellcode analysis using SCDBG revealed bound ports and use of GetProcAddress
- XOR key `0x99` was used to encode the shellcode payload
- Malware identified as `ssms.exe` and tied to CVE-2003-0533 exploitation
