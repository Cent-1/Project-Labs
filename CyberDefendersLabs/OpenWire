# OpenWire - CyberDefenders Lab

## Overview
As a tier-2 SOC analyst, you investigated suspicious outbound connections from a public-facing server. The PCAP revealed exploitation of the OpenWire protocol via Apache ActiveMQ, resulting in reverse shell activity, file downloads, and C2 communication. Your task was to assess the scope of compromise.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- GitHub (for CVE mitigation reference)
- OSINT (CVE research, Docker investigation)

---

## Notes
- Tracked HTTP/TCP streams to trace download activity
- Used packet payload analysis to extract Java exploit behavior
- Verified CVE impact and mitigation via vendor patch analysis

---

## What I Learned

> This lab introduced me to **stream following in Wireshark**, especially HTTP and TCP flows. It gave me a stronger understanding of how different packets are connected and how malicious behaviors manifest in traffic patterns.
