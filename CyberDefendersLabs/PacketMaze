# PacketMaze - CyberDefenders Lab

## Overview
This investigation analyzed a PCAP to confirm unusual outbound activity from an internal host. By reconstructing FTP, DNS, TLS, and HTTP flows in Wireshark and extracting metadata with ExifTool, the analysis identified credentials in cleartext, DNS usage, TLS parameters, and web activity tied to external infrastructure.
