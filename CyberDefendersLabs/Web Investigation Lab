## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- VirusTotal
- IP Geolocation Tools

---

## Notes
- SQL injection activity detected through `search.php` URI manipulation
- POST packets and stream inspection revealed credentials and web shell upload
- HTTP filters like `http contains "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"` and `http contains "bookworld_db"` helped isolate key traffic
